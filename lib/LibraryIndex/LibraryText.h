// Text normalisation for the Library index: the fold used for search and sort
// keys, and the author key that merges spellings of one person.
//
// Nothing here reads a filename. Titles and authors come from the book's own
// metadata; a book whose metadata carries no title falls back to its filename
// stem, unparsed, and one with no author is grouped under Unknown.
//
// Pure functions over UTF-8, no hardware and no allocation beyond the returned
// strings, so the whole unit is host-testable (test/library_text).
//
// Design notes that are easy to get wrong and were measured on a real card
// (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-addendum-a-findability.md, A2.1-A2.8):
//
//   * The fold DECOMPOSES. `utf8ComposeNfc()` goes the other way, so a fold
//     built on it passes on a card holding only decomposed text and then mangles
//     the first precomposed file to arrive from Windows or Calibre. Both forms
//     must produce the same output, and the host tests assert exactly that.
//   * Some letters have no canonical decomposition at all — U+00F8 (ø) is a
//     distinct letter, not o-with-stroke — so a decompose-only fold turns
//     "Søren" into "Sren". Those need an explicit map.
//   * The author KEY sorts its tokens, so for identity purposes name order
//     stops mattering and no First/Last guess is needed there. Display-side
//     helpers do use narrow rules — cleanPersonName inverts a single-comma
//     "Last, First", surnameKey takes the last word — because showing
//     "Austen, Jane" and "Jane Austen" as two people is worse than the guess.

// a filesystem refused to hold.
//
// A single-comma "Austen, Jane" IS turned round into "Jane Austen" — with one
// book per author the spelling vote has no majority to settle it, so the comma
// is the one signal acted on here. Multi-comma names ("Smith, John, Jr.") and

// collapse to one key. Truncation uses the longest complete UTF-8 byte prefix,
// not a token boundary: the sort puts a short forename first, so a whole-token cut would reduce
// "Wollstonecraft, Mary" to "alex" and merge every Alex in the library; the byte
// cut keeps "mary wollsto", still a prefix of the full key.

// "Éluard". `haystack` is the record's stored fold; `needle` is the query put
// through the same fold.
//
// Every query word must PREFIX some word of the book. That is the rule that fits
// the hardware: with no partial refresh, each keypress costs a full ~185 ms panel
// repaint, so the reader wants to stop typing as early as possible. "dar mat"
// — six keys — finds "Wuthering Heights", where a plain substring test would demand the
// whole of one word and give nothing for the effort of a second.

// that "Victor Hugo" and "Hugo Victor" hash alike and are recognised as one person;
// it is a GROUPING key and would be wrong to order by. This is derived from the
// DISPLAY name instead, which is safe because the spelling vote has already made
// every book by one author show the same name — so a group cannot split across
// two places on the shelf.
