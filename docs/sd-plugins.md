# SD-card plugins

CrossPoint keeps service integrations off the firmware. A plugin is a folder on
the SD card; the firmware provides three generic, scheme-neutral surfaces that
plugins compose. Adding or updating a plugin never requires a firmware build,
and the firmware carries no vendor names, URLs, or file-format knowledge.

```
<root>/<name>/
    manifest.json     web UI card metadata (optional): title, description, mount
    plugin.js         browser-side plugin (optional)
    device.json       on-device catalog screen (optional): title, description, ...
    README.md         usage instructions, shown on-device (optional)
    ...assets
```

**Discovery and the on-device list.** Every plugin folder (anything holding a
`manifest.json`, `plugin.js`, or `device.json`) appears under **Settings →
System → Plugins** on the reader, showing its `title` and one-line
`description`. Selecting a plugin with an on-device catalog (`device.json`
with `browse.url`) opens that catalog. Selecting any other plugin shows its
`README.md` (up to 16KB, as plain paged text) when it has one, so even a
browser-only plugin (no `device.json`) can explain how to use it from the web
UI; without a README the row does nothing. `title`/`description` are read from
`manifest.json`, with `device.json` overriding when present.

`<root>` is any of `/.crosspoint/plugins`, `/plugins`, or `/.plugins` — the
first two-dot-free options exist so plugins are easy to copy onto the card
from a computer. All three roots are scanned; on a name collision the earlier
root in that order wins.

A plugin can ship any combination: `plugin.js` alone (web-only),
`device.json` alone (on-device only), or both. A `device.json` may declare only
`events` and omit `browse.url`; that is a valid background/events plugin. It is
listed with its title and description (and may document setup in `README.md`),
and selecting it opens that README when present. It has no catalog action and
is never sent into the catalog error flow.

The plugin sources and examples live in the separate `sd-plugins` repository,
which also documents the browser-side `plugin.js` API. This document covers the
firmware surfaces: the job queue and the `device.json` on-device screens.

## Surface 1: browser plugins (`plugin.js`)

JS loaded into the File Manager or Settings web page, backed by generic device
endpoints (`/api/relay`, `/api/crypto`, `/api/fetch`, `/api/plugin-fs`). See
`docs/webserver-endpoints.md` for the endpoints and the sd-plugins repository
for the JS contract.

## Surface 2: the plugin job queue (external automation)

External systems (a companion app, a script) can trigger plugin actions
without a human clicking the web UI. The firmware stores small opaque
`{plugin, action, args}` JSON blobs in a fixed 6-slot pool; it never interprets
them. Any open page hosting the plugin — including the headless runner at
`GET /plugins-run` — claims jobs, executes the plugin's registered handler in
the browser context, and posts the result back.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/plugin-jobs` | enqueue `{plugin, action, args?}` → `{id}` (503 when the pool is full) |
| `GET /api/plugin-jobs/claim?plugin=` | executor claims the next pending job |
| `POST /api/plugin-jobs/complete` | executor posts `{id, claim, ok, result?}` (`claim` from the claim response; 409 when stale) |
| `GET /api/plugin-jobs/status?id=` | caller polls: `{id, state, result}`; states: `pending`, `running`, `done`, `error`, `unknown` (recycled) |
| `GET /plugins-run` | headless page that loads every plugin (UI hidden) and executes jobs while open |

Flow for an external system:

```sh
# 1. upload whatever the action needs (e.g. a file, via /upload)
# 2. enqueue
curl -X POST http://crosspoint.local/api/plugin-jobs \
  -d '{"plugin":"<name>","action":"<action>","args":{"path":"/folder/file"}}'
# -> {"id":7}
# 3. open http://crosspoint.local/plugins-run in a browser tab or hidden
#    webview (jobs only execute while a hosting page is open)
# 4. poll
curl "http://crosspoint.local/api/plugin-jobs/status?id=7"
# -> {"id":7,"state":"done","result":{...}}
```

Limits: plugin/action names < 24 chars, args and result < 192 bytes of JSON
each. A job claimed by a runner that dies is reclaimable after 10 minutes.
Results persist only until their slot is recycled — poll promptly.

Plugins register handlers in `plugin.js`:

```js
api.registerAction('myaction', async (args) => {
  // runs in the hosting page; throw -> state "error" with {error: message}
  return { anything: 'small' };  // -> state "done" with this result
});
```

## Surface 3: on-device manifests and catalog screens (`device.json`)

A declarative manifest the firmware's generic `PluginCatalogActivity` renders
under **Settings → System → Plugins**. It expresses "authenticated JSON
catalog: sign in, browse, download, sidecar" — enough for most book services —
without any code running on the device. Anything beyond this vocabulary
belongs in `plugin.js`.

`browse.url` makes the manifest an openable catalog. An `events` section
without `browse.url` instead makes it a background/events manifest: discovery
keeps its title/description/README semantics, while the picker deliberately
does not open it as a catalog. A manifest may combine both sections.

The firmware piece (service-agnostic, in `src/activities/plugins/`):
`PluginCatalogActivity`, one activity that opens as a picker over the
installed `device.json` plugins (title + description rows) and morphs into
the manifest-driven browse / download / sign-in flow for the picked plugin.
`discoverPlugins()` rescans the plugin folders each time the picker opens;
nothing stays resident. Browser-only plugins (`plugin.js` without a
`device.json`) are listed as inert "Web-only plugin" rows — an install is
visibly installed — while their UI lives in the web interface.

### Schema

Every string field is a template. Available substitutions:

| Variable | Meaning | Available in |
|---|---|---|
| `{token}` | contents of the token file at `token.path` | everywhere |
| `{cfg.KEY}` | value of `KEY` in the flat JSON config file at `config.file` | everywhere |
| `{page}` | current 1-based page | browse |
| `{limit}` | `page_size + 1` (the extra row detects "more pages") | browse |
| `{id}` `{title}` `{author}` `{url}` | fields of the selected item | download, sidecar |
| `{md5}` | MD5 hex of the destination file path | sidecar |
| `{dest}` | sanitized on-SD path of the downloaded file | sidecar |
| `{device_code}` | from the auth request response | auth poll |

Two browse formats:
- **`"json"`** (default) — a paged JSON list, using `items`/`fields` below.
- **`"xml"`** — walks a repeating XML element with optional folder navigation
  (Confirm opens a folder, Back goes up). No paging; the JSON `items`/
  `page_size` are ignored. The firmware knows no specific protocol: a WebDAV
  `PROPFIND` multistatus, an OPDS/Atom feed, or any XML list is all manifest
  config. XML field selectors are `"elem"` (child element text), `"elem@attr"`
  (child element attribute), or `"@attr"` (attribute on the item element).

```jsonc
{
  "title": "Service Name",                  // menu label; defaults to folder name

  "token": {                                // omit for token-less catalogs

  },

  "config": {                               // optional: flat JSON of {cfg.KEY} values,

        "body": "{\"page\":{page},\"per_page\":{limit},\"list\":\"favorites\"}" }
    ],                                      // omitted keys fall back to browse's

    "resolve_urls": true,                   // resolve url field against the request origin

    "username": "{cfg.user}",              // optional HTTP Basic creds for the file GET

    "filename": "{title}.epub",             // rendered filename is sanitized to 100 bytes;
                                            // a conventional extension is preserved
    "sidecar": {                            // optional per-book metadata file
      "path": "{dest}.meta.json",             // the book metadata sidecar convention (see plugin-events.md)
      "body": "{\"book_id\":{id}}"
    }
  },

  "auth": {                                 // optional on-device sign-in
    "type": "device_code",                  // or "password"

    // device_code (interactive: shows a code + QR, polls until authorized):
    "request": { "url": "...", "method": "POST", "headers": { ... }, "body": "..." },
    "poll":    { "url": "...", "method": "POST", "headers": { ... },
                 "body": "{...\"device_code\":\"{device_code}\"}" },
    // device_code response field paths, with their defaults:
    "code_path": "user_code", "verify_url_path": "verification_uri",
    "device_code_path": "device_code", "interval_path": "interval",
    "expires_path": "expires_in", "token_path": "access_token",
    "error_path": "error"

    // password (silent: mints a token from stored config credentials — for
    // OAuth2 password grants and login-returns-token APIs). Only "request" and
    // "token_path" apply; no user interaction:
    //   "type": "password",
    //   "request": { "url": "{cfg.url}/oauth/v2/token", "method": "POST",
    //                "headers": {...}, "body": "...{cfg.username}...{cfg.password}..." },
    //   "token_path": "access_token"
  }
}
```

### Behavior

- **Sign-in (`device_code`)**: the not-signed-in screen offers Sign in on the
  device: it shows the verification URL (text + QR) and user code, then polls
  until authorized, honoring `authorization_pending`, `slow_down`,
  `expired_token`, and `access_denied`. The token is written to `token.file`
  in the shape `token.path` expects, so the web plugin and the device share
  one sign-in.
- **Sign-in (`password`)**: no on-device UI — the device silently POSTs the
  stored config credentials to the token endpoint before browsing, and re-mints
  a fresh token automatically after any 401 (these tokens are short-lived).
  Credentials come from a browser `plugin.js` writing the `config.file`. Set it
  up once on the web page; the reader is then standalone.
- Without an `auth` block the not-signed-in screen directs the user to the web
  plugin.
- **Stale tokens**: a 401/403 from browse returns to the sign-in screen rather
  than an error.
- **Pagination** (json): the browse request should return up to `{limit}`
  items; the firmware displays `page_size` and uses the extra row to know
  another page exists. Navigation matches the OPDS browser: a "Previous
  page" row precedes the items past page 1 and a "Next page" row follows
  them while more pages exist — tappable and button-reachable like any row.
- **Lists** (json): with `browse.lists`, opening the catalog shows a picker
  of the named entries first; each entry browses with its own url/body
  overrides (server-side categories, shelves, sort orders). Back from the
  book list returns to the picker.
- **XML navigation**: Confirm on a folder (an item carrying `container_element`)
  descends into it, Back climbs out (Back at the root leaves the screen).
  With `resolve_urls`, server-relative URLs resolve against the browse URL's
  origin. A `config.file` lets values like a server URL and credentials be
  user-entered (via a browser `plugin.js`) rather than baked into the manifest.
- **After download**: the book's layout cache is invalidated and the optional
  sidecar is written. Use the `{dest}.meta.json` convention so the fields ride
  KOSync progress uploads and event handlers (see `plugin-events.md`).

### Heap budget (ESP32-C3, ~380KB total)

- Manifest ≤ 8KB, token file ≤ 2KB, small API responses (auth, download-url
  hop) ≤ 48KB (hard caps).
- Browse responses (json and xml) stream to an SD temp file and are parsed
  from it, so the raw body never occupies DRAM — services that inline heavy
  per-item metadata (a page of BookFusion JSON runs 60+ KB) work unmodified.
  A 1MB cap bounds a misbehaving server.
- Catalog responses are parsed with a dynamically built ArduinoJson filter
  containing only the declared field paths, so a page parses into a few KB
  no matter the body size.
- One TLS session is kept alive across browse requests: repeated handshakes
  permanently fragment the heap.
- The book download streams to SD via `HttpDownloader`; file size is
  unconstrained.
- An XML list is parsed from the temp file in 2KB chunks; the engine stops
  after 200 entries per folder/feed. Split very large libraries into
  subfolders.

### Testing a new manifest

1. Copy the plugin folder to `/.crosspoint/plugins/<name>/` on the SD card.
2. Settings → System → Plugins → your title. With no token and no `auth`
   block you should see the not-signed-in screen; with `auth`, the code/QR
   screen.
3. Watch serial (`[PCAT]` tag) for request/parse failures — the log includes
   HTTP status and truncation flags.
4. Token-less services (public JSON APIs) work by omitting the `token` block
   entirely; that is the quickest way to validate `items`/`fields` paths.

## Surface 4: firmware events and the book metadata sidecar

The firmware can record whitelisted moments (`reader.session`, sleep entry, a
catalog download finished) into a per-plugin queue
and later replay them through HTTP request templates declared in
`device.json` — including bounded WiFi bring-up at sleep entry for handlers
that opt in. A companion convention, the `<book path>.meta.json` sidecar,
lets plugins attach service fields (e.g. a service book id) to a book; those
fields ride along with KOSync progress uploads and are available to event
handlers as `{meta.*}` variables. See `plugin-events.md` for the whole
surface: the event whitelist, handler schema, delivery semantics, and limits.

## Ideas to build

The two planes decide *how* you build something, so pick by what the idea needs:

- **On-device (`device.json`)** — standalone on the reader, but only the
  declarative vocabulary above: an authenticated JSON or XML/OPDS-style catalog,
  browse, download to SD, optional device-code or password sign-in and per-book
  sidecar. No arbitrary logic.
- **Browser (`plugin.js`)** — anything at all (any protocol, auth, format), but
  it runs in a connected browser/app. Use it when the idea needs request
  signing, HTML→EPUB conversion, multi-file writes, or a real UI. The job queue
  (`/api/plugin-jobs` + `/plugins-run`) lets an external app trigger it.

Rule of thumb: if the service is "log in, list an authenticated JSON/XML
catalog, download files," it's on-device. If it needs computed request bodies
(OAuth 1.0a signing, canonicalized signatures) or format conversion, it's
browser-side.

### On-device (`device.json`) ideas

- **Self-hosted library presets** — Kavita, Komga, Audiobookshelf, Calibre-Web,
  COPS. Most expose OPDS (native OPDS browsing already covers those — a plugin
  adds value mainly for their JSON APIs or token auth). Build: `browse.format`
  `json` against the REST API, or `xml` against the OPDS feed; `download.url`
  from the entry; bearer/Basic/`{cfg.*}` auth. See `bookfusion` (JSON + token)
  and `webdav` (XML + config creds).
- **Dictionary store** — browse a JSON index of dictionary files, download to
  the SD dictionary dir. No native equivalent. Build: token-less `json` catalog,
  `download.dest_dir` = the dictionary folder, no sidecar. ~15 lines.
- **Theme store / font store** — same shape as the dictionary store, pointed at
  the theme or font directory. Asset catalogs OPDS can't express.
- **More read-later that exports EPUB** — anything with a token API and an
  EPUB export URL fits like `wallabag`: `auth.type` `password` (or a stored
  bearer), `browse` the entries JSON, `download` the export endpoint with a
  Bearer header.
- **A curated free-books catalog** — Standard Ebooks / Gutenberg via their OPDS
  feed (`xml` format, token-less). Overlaps native OPDS, but ships as a
  zero-config preset.

### Browser (`plugin.js`) ideas

- **Plugin store** — install other plugins from a hosted catalog. Build: fetch
  a catalog with `api.relay`, `/mkdir` the target folder, `api.writeFile` each
  file. See `plugin-store/`.
- **AO3 / fanfiction downloader** — the site serves per-work EPUB downloads.
  Build: take a work URL, `api.fetchToSd` (or `api.relay` + `api.writeFile`) the
  EPUB to SD. Browsing/search is HTML, so parse it in the browser.
- **RSS → EPUB digest** — build a "morning edition." Fetch feeds with
  `api.relay`, assemble an EPUB in the browser with the JSZip the File Manager
  page already loads, then `api.writeFile` it to SD.
- **Read-any-article** — paste a URL, run it through a readability service via
  `api.relay`, wrap the result as an EPUB, write to SD.
- **Metadata / cover editor** — a File Manager plugin: open an EPUB with JSZip,
  edit the OPF (title/author/cover), rewrite it in place. See
  `organize-by-author/` for the File-Manager-endpoints pattern.
- **Library tidy tools** — dedupe, bulk rename, move-by-metadata. Same
  same-origin endpoints (`/api/files`, `/mkdir`, `/move`, `/delete`), no device
  API needed.
- **Signed-API services** (Instapaper OAuth 1.0a, etc.) — must be browser-side:
  do the per-request signing in JS with `crypto.subtle`, relay the calls, and
  convert the article HTML to EPUB before writing to SD.

### Building blocks reference

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Outbound HTTP(S), any method (CORS-free) | `api.relay(method, url, headers, body)` |
| Download a URL straight to SD | `api.fetchToSd(url, dest, headers)` |
| Write a small file to SD | `api.writeFile(path, base64)` |
| Crypto (hash, HMAC via SHA, AES, RSA) | `api.crypto(op, fields)` or browser `crypto.subtle` |
| Create / delete / move SD files | same-origin `/mkdir`, `/delete`, `/move` |
| On-device catalog/browse/download | `device.json` (this document) |
| External app triggers an action | `api.registerAction(name, fn)` + `/api/plugin-jobs` |

## Protected content and loan expiry

Books whose entries are content-protected open through the read path in
`lib/Epub/ContentProtection.cpp`: the access credential lives at
`/.crosspoint/content.key`, and an out-of-band rights document may sit next to
the book as `<book>.epub.rights` (falling back to a rights file inside the
zip). Entries decrypt on demand, streamed in small chunks; nothing decrypted
is ever written to SD.

When the rights carry a due date, the reader enforces it against
`lib/TrustedTime`: a monotonic clock floor persisted in NVS (on-flash, not on
the removable card), restored into the system clock at boot, advanced at
every sleep entry and snapped to real time by SNTP on every Wi-Fi join. The
floor can lag real time while the device sits powered off, but it can never
be rolled back — staying offline delays a due date at most by the powered-off
gap, it does not suspend it. A book with a due date and no trustworthy clock
at all refuses to open and asks for one Wi-Fi connection.
