class GfxRenderer;

// Firmware event hooks for SD plugins.
//
// The firmware emits a small whitelisted set of events; a plugin's device.json
// subscribes by declaring an "events" section whose handlers are the same
// declarative request objects the catalog vocabulary uses:
//
//   "events": {
//     "reader.exit": {
//       "request": { "method": "POST", "url": "https://...", "headers": {...},
//                    "body": "{\"book\":\"{event.book}\",\"pct\":{event.percent}}" },
//       "toast": "Synced {event.book}"
//     },
//     "sleep.enter": {
//       "download": { "url": "https://.../daily.bmp", "dest": "/sleep.bmp" }
//     }
//   }
//
// A handler is either a "request" (response discarded; an acknowledgement) or
// a "download" (response streamed to `dest` on SD, e.g. a sleep image).
//
// Execution is deferred: plugin handlers need the network, and events mostly
// fire with WiFi down (leaving the reader, entering sleep). emit() appends one
// JSON line to the plugin's SD outbox (<plugin dir>/events.jsonl) and costs
// nothing beyond that; drain() later replays queued events through the
// declared requests whenever the device is already online. Substitution in
// url/body/headers/toast: {token}, {cfg.KEY}, and the event's {event.*} vars.
//
// sleep.enter exists to act before the chip powers down (a fresh sleep image,
// a pre-sleep progress push), so subscribing implies "connect": true: the
// sleep path brings WiFi up to deliver it at sleep entry rather than waiting
// for the next online session. Delivery stays at-least-once — a failed
// sleep-time drain leaves the events queued for the next drain.
//
// Whitelist only: unknown names in a manifest are ignored with a log line, so
// manifests written against newer firmware degrade gracefully. Event names are
// a compatibility promise (semantic, not activity class names).

// backlog cannot stall an interactive session. Successfully delivered events
// leave the outbox; failures stay for the next drain. When `renderer` is
// non-null, a handler's "toast" template is shown via the standard popup after
// its request succeeds.
